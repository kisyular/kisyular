# Hi, I'm Rellika Kisyula 👋

**Data Analyst | Full-Stack Developer | Business Analytics Graduate Student**

I transform complex data into actionable insights using Python, SQL, and modern analytics tools. With a unique blend of quantitative analysis and full-stack development skills, I build data-driven solutions that solve real-world problems in finance, healthcare, and technology.

Currently pursuing my M.Sc. in Business Analytics at the University of Louisville while working on cutting-edge projects involving machine learning, RAG systems, and data visualization.
